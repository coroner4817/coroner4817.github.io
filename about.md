# About

<!--author-->

Hi there, glad you find me here. 

I am **Yingnan Wang**, an engineer who is trying to have a better understand of this world.  

This blog was created during 2020, the year of the pandemic, when I mostly stayed at home and had more time thinking about the technologies I am interested in. I believe that the innovation comes from collision, fusion and evolution of ideas from different fields. So I am trying to explore the knowledge beyond my area as much as possible and use this blog to record my path of learning. You will find me talking about:  

- [Computer Graphics and PBR](/graphics/)
- [SfM and SLAM](/3dvision/)
- [Deep Learning and AI](/deeplearning/)
- [Computer Vision]()
- [Parallel Computing]()
- [Augmented Reality]()
- [Game Development]()
